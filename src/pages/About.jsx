            <p>Hi there! You can call me Joseph Okivie. I'm pursuing a career in software engineering by enrolling in programs at the Colombia Coding Bootcamp. I'm excited to explore the world of technology . I'm excited to combine my enthusiasm in javascript and react with my programming expertise. Through my coding bootcamp, I've had the chance to work with HTML, CSS, and JS for front-end development. Regarding backend programming,Â I have a strong curiosity about learning and have realized how crucial it is to apply what I study. Applying my knowledge and skills through this incredible training has allowed me to study more and broaden my knowledge as technology advances. I'm thrilled to be a part of the incredible world of technology, even though there will always be more to learn</p>
